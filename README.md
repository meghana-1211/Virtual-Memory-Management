# 🧠 Virtual Memory Management in RISC-V (Sv39)

This project explores **virtual memory** in the **RISC-V architecture**, focusing on how paging and memory isolation are handled using **hierarchical page tables** and the **SATP** mechanism.

The assignment gives hands-on experience with:
- Creating and configuring page tables
- Working with different privilege modes (Machine, Supervisor, and User)
- Using the `satp` register for paging
- Verifying address translations on execution

---

## 🚀 Problem Overview

Modern computer systems use virtual memory to efficiently manage physical memory and isolate processes. RISC-V supports this using **Sv39 paging**, a hierarchical page table scheme that allows for 39-bit virtual addressing.

In this assignment, we simulate virtual memory behavior by:

1. Switching privilege levels
2. Setting up the page table
3. Configuring the SATP register
4. Entering user mode
5. Observing virtual-to-physical address translation

---

## 🛠️ Steps Involved

### ✅ Step 1: Switch from Machine Mode to Supervisor Mode

Begin by changing the privilege level of execution using the appropriate CSRs (`mstatus`, `mepc`, etc.).

---

### ✅ Step 2: Initialize the Page Table

Set up the page table entries in memory, following the **Sv39** hierarchical format. Ensure proper alignment and permission bits are configured based on the desired mappings.

### ✅ Step 3: Configure the SATP Register

Write the appropriate configuration into the `satp` register:
- Set mode to Sv39
- Assign the physical address of the root page table
- Update other required fields (ASID, etc.)

---

### ✅ Step 4: Switch to User Mode

After configuring the page table and `satp`, switch the privilege level to **User Mode** and start execution.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Observe Address Translation

Check the memory dumps or Spike logs to confirm that physical addresses are being replaced with their corresponding virtual addresses — indicating successful paging.

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure all memory structures (page tables, stack, etc.) are properly aligned.
- Use `spike` and `pk` or `qemu-riscv64` to test your program.
- Debug using `--dump-dts` or log outputs from memory dumps.
